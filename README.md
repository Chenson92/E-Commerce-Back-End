## Description

This is a back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. It has a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. You will need to add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file to be able to connect to a database using Sequelize. Then you need to enter schema and seed commands to create and seed a development database.

## Installation

- Uses the MySQL2 package to connect to a MySQL database.
- Stores MySQL username, password, and database name, using the dotenv package.
